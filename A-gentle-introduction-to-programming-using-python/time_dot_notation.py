"""As an exercise, write a function called print_time that takes a Time object and prints it in the form hour:minute:second. Hint: the format sequence '%.2d' prints an integer using at least two digits, including a leading zero if necessary.
Write a boolean function called is_after that takes two Time objects, t1 and t2, and re- turns True if t1 follows t2 chronologically and False otherwise. Challenge: donâ€™t use an if statement."""
