# About this material

Some of the motivations behind the creation and organization of this material are:
* Most universities unfortunatelly are not good universities, if you agree to this and think that if you really want to learn you need to be an autodidact then this material might suit you well.
* Most paid educational materials are market-prone, which means they have no compromisse with scientific nor academic rigour
* High Quality Educational Material (HQEM) for autodictacts is sometimes hard to find so Im basing my picks in top universities, books and courses that I personally went through and think its worth sharing.

# My personal HQEM picks for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
